        <h1>My Journey into Machine Learning</h1>
        <time>January 15, 2025</time>

        <p>For the past year, I've been diving deep into machine learning, and it's been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my technical career. This post is a reflection on what I've learned, the mistakes I made, and the resources that helped me along the way.</p>

        <h2>Why Machine Learning?</h2>

        <p>My interest in ML started during my work on the DolphinGemma project at Georgia Tech. We were processing thousands of bioacoustic audio samples, and I realized that traditional algorithms weren't cutting it. We needed something smarter‚Äîsomething that could learn patterns we couldn't explicitly program.</p>

        <p>That realization led me down a rabbit hole of neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation. At first, it was overwhelming. But as I started building small projects and seeing them work, I was hooked.</p>

        <h2>The Learning Path</h2>

        <p>I started with Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. It's a classic for a reason‚Äîthe fundamentals are explained clearly, and the math isn't too intimidating if you have a decent calculus background.</p>

        <p>After that, I moved to more practical implementations. I built:</p>

        <p><strong>A digit classifier</strong> using the MNIST dataset (the "Hello World" of ML)<br>
        <strong>A sentiment analyzer</strong> for movie reviews<br>
        <strong>A simple image recognition system</strong> using CNNs</p>

        <p>Each project taught me something new about data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.</p>

        <h2>Key Lessons</h2>

        <h3>1. Data is everything</h3>

        <p>You can have the best model architecture in the world, but if your data is dirty or biased, your results will be too. I spent more time cleaning and preprocessing data than I did building models.</p>

        <h3>2. Start simple</h3>

        <p>My first instinct was always to reach for the most complex model. But I learned that starting with a simple baseline (like logistic regression) helps you understand your data better and gives you a benchmark to beat.</p>

        <h3>3. Understanding the math matters</h3>

        <p>Early on, I tried to skip the math and just use libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. That worked until something broke. Understanding backpropagation and gradient descent made debugging so much easier.</p>

        <h2>Tools I Use</h2>

        <p>Here's my current ML toolkit:</p>

        <pre><code>Python 3.10
TensorFlow / Keras
PyTorch (for research projects)
NumPy & Pandas
Jupyter Notebooks
Google Colab (for GPU access)</code></pre>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>

        <p>I'm currently exploring reinforcement learning and generative AI. The field moves incredibly fast, and there's always something new to learn. My advice to anyone starting out: don't try to learn everything at once. Pick a project that excites you, and learn what you need to build it.</p>

        <p>Machine learning isn't magic‚Äîit's math, statistics, and a lot of trial and error. But when you finally get that model working and see it make accurate predictions, it feels like magic.</p>
